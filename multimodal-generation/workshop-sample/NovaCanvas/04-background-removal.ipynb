    "OctankFashion want to reuse some of the marketing images of their shirts on their retail website product pages. Their website design standards dictate that all product images must have a transparent background so as not to distract from the shirt's design. Nova Canvas's background removal features is perfect for this task.\n",

    "To use this feature, you just need to provide the image to the model. The model will automatically determine which parts of the image should be considered foreground and background, no prompting required!\n"
